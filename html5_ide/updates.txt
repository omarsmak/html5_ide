1- First time load the tree , write a function to check and manipulate the database according to the folder . #FIX : Just maintain the databse same as the folder structure
2- Second , write small function to delete , add , rename , move files and add them to jstree class .
3- Try to load the files in such way that can open in the editor (open sourc) .


/* to do later 
1- Once the file managment finish , try to start doing the code bit



/Notes :
1- After copy must refresh

/Success
1- Now I can hashed any project : ex.
www.kkkk.com/workplace/user/hdg77ej/test.html
Remeber : explode the hash code to get the file name

2- Create a constant path to workplace folder #done

3- Create a hased project like this 
//authorized
http://localhost/main/application/:project_hash insted of using project ID #done

4- Create project view   #done
//open for public
http://localhost/public/workplace/:project_hash


5- Create default ctp* and a contoller to map them #done

/To Do :

1- Automate the creating proccess for the whole project __#done
2- Move all the files to workplace folder __#done
3- Link the hash key with the files and folder and figure out a way how to do so . #done
4- Fix the right , left and position __#done
5- Load the files contents into the editor #done #done
6- Open Multiple tabs 
7- CodeBits section 
8- We don't want the same file name created (do it later)
9- Preview File #done
10- Error msg in case the file is not there
11- Save file #done
12- Create the codebits

/Suggestions 
1- Hash navigationas using jQuery History plugin
2- In the future use all mapping by the hash key 
3- Check for file having the same name
